# X4Delayed_Start
*Originally developed before Kingdom End, Never released but mostly works, last step was to hook into the MD of the dlc scripts to hold them until the right time and polish.
Goals : 
  An admittedly hacky way to not have all the dlcs enabled to start with, but to delay their complete activation artificially by isolating the sector.
  While configurable, The idea was for the player to go to each gate and watch them open, or have it happen after a few hours in chronological order. 
  Should the player use a DLC start that put them in one of the locked out sectors, they could run through a version of that area locked out of the core commonwealth for a few hours or so.

Default Unlock Order:

  Base Game Patch Gates   

  Split Xenon Gates
  
  Split Dlc Gates
  
  Terran Gates
  
  Yaki Gates
  
  Pirate Gates
